input 14:
        void __A::__init (A __this) {
         __this->some = (A) __rt::null();
         }

         need to init every undeclared field as null


           __rt::checkNotNull(other);

           print this in main

input 16:
    Throw ClassCastException

input 17:
    C++ does not allow a variable and a method to be the same name whereas Java does
    Also, nested CallExpression here which doesn't work

input 23:
    We need to somehow convert main char* argv[] into a Java string

input 27:
    exception arrayIndexOutOfBoundsException


--------- Multidimensional Array ---------
input 30:
    Create multidimensional array

input 31:
    Nested for loop
    length of array || ex. array.length


------------ Method Overloading ------------
input 32:
    Overload 6 methods || 1 with return type int
                       || 5 with void

input 33:
    Same as input 32 but all methods are STATIC

input 34:
    Add 2 variables as arguments || ex. a.foo(var + var)

input 35:
    Same as input 34 but Class A remove one method that takes int as arg

input 36:
    Lots of objects as args
    Lots of casting as Object


------------ Method Overloading AND Overriding ------------
input 37:
    Same as input 36 but Class B extends A
    Class B has no methods so it inherits everything from A
    Main calls b.foo but only Class A's implementation

input 38:
    Same as input 37 but Class B OVERRIDES ALL the methods in Class A

input 39:
    Same as input 38 but line 18 REMOVED a CASTING as Object

input 40:
    Same as input 39 but Class C EXTENDS A and C has NO overriding

input 41:
    Same as input 40 but Class has ONE method that might override

input 42:
    Nested Call Expression and shit
